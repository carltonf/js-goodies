* [[./htmlEncode][htmlEncode/htmlDecode]]
This might be too simple to be a goodie on its own. But answers at [[Origin]]
suggest it the other way. Key notes:

- Still not a built-in API in HTML.
- 'replace' is the widely used method (as it has no extra dependencies)
- =underscore= has built-in support.
